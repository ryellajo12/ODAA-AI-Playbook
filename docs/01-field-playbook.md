## 4. AI Patterns on Oracle Database@Azure -- Overview

All patterns fall into three categories based on how Oracle data flows into the AI ecosystem.

### Zero Data Movement -- Live Oracle Data

Agents query Oracle Database@Azure directly at runtime. No data leaves Oracle.

| Pattern | AI Platform | How It Connects | Surfaces | Value Proposition |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| **1** | **Copilot Studio** | Gateway / Oracle as Knowledge / Oracle as Tool | Teams, Web, M365 | - Fastest time-to-value (hours)<br/>- No-code builder<br/>- Business users self-serve answers<br/>- Zero data movement |

### Managed Replication -- Mirrored Analytics Data

Oracle data is replicated into Fabric Mirrored Database via managed private endpoints. Data Agents on Mirrored Database can be published as MCP servers, to Teams, or connected to Copilot Studio and MS Foundry via native connectors.

| Pattern | AI Platform | How It Connects | Surfaces | Value Proposition |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| **Pattern 8** | **Mirrored Database + Data Agents** | Oracle --> Fabric Mirroring (private PE) --> Mirrored Database --> Data Agents --> Published as MCP Server / Teams / Copilot Studio / Foundry | Teams, Copilot Studio, Foundry, MCP clients | - NL analytics on mirrored Oracle data<br/>- Data Agent as MCP server for any client<br/>- Publish direct to Teams<br/>- Native connectors to Copilot Studio + Foundry<br/>- Entra ID + private networking end-to-end |
| **Pattern 9** | **Fabric Mirroring + Data Agents + Foundry** | Mirrored Database --> Data Agent --> Foundry agent (native connector as tool) | API, M365 Copilot, Agent Store | - Foundry agent uses Data Agent as a tool<br/>- Combine mirrored analytics with live MCP/ORDS<br/>- Best of Fabric + Foundry<br/>- Entra ID RBAC at every layer |

### AI Enrichment: IQ -- Intelligent Data Processing

AI-powered intelligence layers that process, enrich, and surface insights from structured, unstructured, and work data.

| Pattern | AI Platform | What It Does | Surfaces | Value Proposition |
|--|--|--|--|--|

## 6. Objection Handling

| Objection | Response |
|--|--|
| *"We can't move our Oracle data"* | You don't have to. Zero Data Movement patterns (Patterns 1-7) all work on live Oracle data with zero data movement. Managed Replication uses managed Fabric mirroring only if analytics require it. |
| *"We're worried about security and governance"* | Oracle Database@Azure runs in Azure with full network isolation (Private Endpoints, VNETs). Oracle MCP operates inside Oracle DB security -- it doesn't bypass it. All patterns support Entra ID. See [Security & Governance](10-security-governance.md) for full guardrails. |
| *"We don't know where to start"* | Start with a single-scenario pilot. Most customers begin with Copilot Studio (Pattern 1 -- 48-hour proof of value) or an MCP demo (Pattern 5 -- 2-hour setup in VS Code). |
| *"We already have a vector database"* | Oracle 26ai has native vector support -- one fewer service to manage. But Microsoft Foundry agents can also call external vector DBs via tools. Your choice. |
| *"Is MCP production-ready?"* | MCP is an open standard (Anthropic-initiated, now broadly adopted). Oracle's SQLcl MCP server is GA. For production, host on Azure Functions with Entra ID auth and API Management. See [Path 3 -- Oracle MCP](05-oracle-mcp.md). |
| *"What about cost?"* | Start with free/low-cost paths: MCP local is free; Copilot Studio has per-message pricing; Azure OpenAI is pay-per-token. No upfront platform investment required. |
| *"We need multi-agent orchestration"* | Microsoft Foundry supports multi-agent patterns natively. Combine with MCP tools for Oracle access and 26ai vectors for RAG. See [Combined Patterns](09-combined-patterns.md). |
